This project is to create a graph that will allow me to visualize all the members of a server and their connections//people they've brought into the server.

## How to Run this Repository
Clone this repository to your local and run
> pip install -r requirements.txt

To run the test cases on the back-end logic:
> python -m unittest discover 

If you add more test cases, make sure to also add a file called "__init__.py" to the new module/directory(if you created one)
No, I don't understand how it works, but it does for some reason.

Please refer to the Project Board on any TODOs for this repository.
